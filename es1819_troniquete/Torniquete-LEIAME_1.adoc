== UML state machine 

UML state machine is an object-based variant of Harel statechart adapted and extended by UML.



* An **event** is something that happens that affects the system.
* Each state machine has a **state**, which governs reaction of the state machine to events.


=== (FSM)


=== Estado (State) 



* Entry Action 
* Exit Action  

Transição (Transition)

== Extended State Machines 

* Transition can have a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Guard_conditions[guard], which means that the transition can "fire" only if the guard evaluates to TRUE.

== Hierarchical state machines (HSM)

hierarchically nested states

* substate
* superstate


* composite states - States that contain other states;
* simple states - states without internal structure
* nested state is called a direct substate when it is not contained by any other state; otherwise, it is referred to as a transitively nested substate
